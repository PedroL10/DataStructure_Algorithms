# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms study repository! This repository contains all my study materials, code implementations, and progress related to data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my studies on data structures and algorithms. It serves as a personal learning log and a showcase of my knowledge.

## Goals

- To understand and implement various data structures and algorithms.
- To improve problem-solving skills.
- To prepare for technical interviews.
- To document my learning journey and progress.

## Study Plan

I am following the [Java Data Structures and Algorithms Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-data-structures-and-algorithms-masterclass/) on Udemy and using the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
