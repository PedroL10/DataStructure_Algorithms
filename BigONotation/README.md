# What is Big O???

## Big O Notation
    This is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its runtime or space requirements as the input size grows. It focuses on the asymptotic behavior, meaning how the algorithm performs as the input size approaches infinity.

## Time complexity 
    This refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It’s expressed using Big O notation, such as O(1) for constant time, O(n) for linear time, O(n^2) for quadratic time, etc.

## Space Complexity
    This refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It’s also expressed using Big O notation, such as O(1) for constant space, O(n) for linear space, etc.
